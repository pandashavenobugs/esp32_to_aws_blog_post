# Introduction

In this blog post, we're going to connect an ESP32 microcontroller to AWS IoT Core. We'll use DynamoDB for data storage and trigger AWS Lambda functions, all programmed in Golang. This guide is perfect for anyone interested in building IoT projects using ESP32 and AWS. We'll walk through each step, making it easy to follow along, even if you're new to these technologies. Letâ€™s get started!

## Technologies and Techniques Used

In this project, we utilize a range of technologies and techniques to achieve seamless integration between the ESP32 microcontroller and AWS services. Here's a breakdown of what we use:

### Hardware Side:

- **PlatformIO**: An open-source ecosystem for IoT development.
- **Arduino**: The programming platform for our ESP32 microcontroller.
- **C++ (CPP)**: The programming language used for ESP32 development.
- **knolleary/pubsubclient**: A client library for MQTT messaging.
- **LittleFS**: A file system for handling files on the ESP32.

### Cloud and Backend Side:

- **AWS IoT Core**: Manages and connects IoT devices.
- **DynamoDB**: AWS's NoSQL database service for handling device data.
- **Lambda Function**: AWS service for running backend code in response to events.
- **Golang**: The programming language used for writing AWS Lambda functions.
